# Potree Core 2.0

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/potree-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/potree-core)
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tentone%2Fpotree-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tentone%2Fpotree-core)

 - This project was originally based on [Potree Viewer 1.6](https://github.com/potree/potree) and is now since version 2.0 based on the [shiukaheng fork](https://github.com/shiukaheng/potree-loader) of the [Potree-Loader](https://github.com/pnext/three-loader).
 - Potree is a web based pouint cloud visualizer project created by Markus Sch√ºtz.
 - This project contains only the main parts of the potree project adapted to be more easily used as a independent library, the code was adapted from the original repositorys.
 - Support for pointclouds from LAS, LAZ, Binary files.
 - Some features require support for the following GL extensions
   - EXT_frag_depth, WEBGL_depth_texture, OES_vertex_array_object

## Demo
 - Live demo at https://tentone.github.io/potree-core/
 - Double click the models to raycast the scene and create marker points.

## Example
 - The project can be build running the commands `npm install` and `npm run build`.
 - Download the potree build from the build folder or add it to your project using NPM.
 - Include it alonside the worker folder in your project (can be found on the source folder).
 - The build is a ES module, that can be imported to other projects, threejs should be available as a peer dependency.
 - Bellow its a fully functional example of how to use this wrapper to load potree point clouds to a three.js project

```javascript
const scene = new Scene();
const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(60, 1, 0.1, 10000);

const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");

const renderer = new WebGLRenderer({canvas:canvas});

const geometry = new BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
const cube = new Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, canvas);
camera.position.z = 10;

const pointClouds = [];

const baseUrl = "data/test/";
const potree = new Potree();
potree.loadPointCloud("cloud.js", url => `${baseUrl}${url}`,).then(function(pco) {
   scene.add(pco);
	pointClouds.push(pco);
});

function loop()
{
   potree.updatePointClouds(pointClouds, camera, renderer);

	controls.update();
	renderer.render(scene, camera);

	requestAnimationFrame(loop);
};
loop();
```

## Custom Request Manager
   - The potree core library uses a custom request manager to handle the loading of point cloud data.
   - The request manager can be replaced by a custom implementation, for example to use a custom caching system or to handle requests in a different way.

   ```javascript
   class CustomRequestManager implements RequestManager 
   {
      fetch(input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response> {
         throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
      }

      async getUrl(url: string): Promise<string> {
         return url;
      }
   }
   ```   

## Notes
 - Since potree-core is meant to be used as library and not as a full software as potree some features are not available.
 - EDL shading is not supported by potree core.
 - Removed classification and clipping functionality.
 - Removed Arena 4D point cloud support.
 - Removed Entwine Point Tile file support.
 - GUI elements were removed from the library
   - PotreeViewer
   - Controls, Input, GUI, Tools
   - Anotations, Actions, ProfileRequest
   - Potree.startQuery, Potree.endQuery and Potree.resolveQueries
   - Potree.timerQueries
   - Potree.MOUSE, Potree.CameraMode
   - PotreeRenderer, RepRenderer, Potree.Renderer
     - JQuery, TWEEN and Proj4 dependencies


## Potree Converter
 - Use the (Potree Converter)[https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/releases] tool to create point cloud data from LAS, ZLAS or BIN point cloud files
 - Potree Converter 1.8 creates a multi file structure with each node as an individual file.
 - Potree Converter 2.1 creates a single file for all points and separates files for hierarchy index, its faster to create files. Requires a HTTP server configured for file streaming.
 - Tool to create hierarquical structure used for point-cloud rendering using potree-core.
 - There are two main versions 2.1 witch generates 4 contained files with point data, hierarchy, 
 - To generate a folder output from a input file run the command `.\PotreeConverter '..\input.laz' -o ../output`


### TXT2LAS
 - The potree converter tool only supports las and laz files, so textural file formats such as .pts, .xyz, have to be first converted into a supported format.
 - The TXT2LAS tool from the (LASTools)[https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools] repository can be used for this effect.
 - To run the tool use the command `.\txt2las64 -i input.pts -ipts -parse xyziRGB  -set_scale 0.001 0.001 0.001 -set_version 1.4 -o output.laz`


 ### To Do
 - Supports logarithmic depth buffer (just by enabling it on the threejs renderer), useful for large scale visualization.
 - Point clouds are automatically updated, frustum culling is used to avoid unnecessary updates (better update performance for multiple point clouds).
